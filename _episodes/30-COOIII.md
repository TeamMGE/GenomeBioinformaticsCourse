#  Scaling up

In your last working day, you performed a series of phylogenetic analyses that allowed you to classify the genomes you found. 
One of them had a somewhat unclear affiliation based on the 16S rRNA gene, but a phylogenomic analysis indicated this was a
bona fide Asgard archaeon. 

Chatting with another research group, you realise they have recently recovered genomes that are quite similar. 
But there is one particularity: they have obtained said genomes from hot springs.

In order to better understand how this group may have adapted to both mesophilic and thermophilic environments, you decide
to partner up and work on this together.
