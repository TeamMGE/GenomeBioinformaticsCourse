title: "Block 2 - COOI putting it all together on the species tree"
start: false
teaching: 0:00
exercises: 30
questions:
- Can we project the events from the annotated RasGEF tree onto the species tree
objectives:
- Practice seeing how events on a gene tree correspond to events on a species tree 
keypoints:
- an annotated gene tree corresponds to events on a species tree

So we have looked at the RasGEFs by hand and by NOTUNG. We should now have some kind of consensus on what events happened in this gene tree. Now we are going to project all these events on the species ttee. I think for this we should use the correct (and thus fully resolved) species tree which we have given in one of the earlie rexercises and here below. On this species tree we want to see the  events (i.e. losses and duplications) as well as the ancestral gene content, e.g. how many RasGEFs dit the animal ancestor prosses. This will give a reconstruction of the ancestral repertoire of RasGEF proteins. So specifically what you need to do is: 

Think about which reconciliation you are going to use for this? 
Mark, with e.g. an asterix, in the gene phylogeny those speciations that correspond to a single gene in the last common ancestor (LCA) of the species considered (i.e. the common ancestor of amoebozoa, animals & fungi). 



Consider all genes that descend from each of these speciation an "orthologous group". How many (orthologous groups of) RasGEFs were present at which ancestor?
How many loss and duplications of (orthologous groups of) RasGEF happened at which branch?

>> So first I would consider the gene tree from before with respect to the LCA speciation nodes. And count how many I see. \

IF we look at the tree we can see which

Human, C.elegans and Dyctiostelium possess most “ancestral” RasGEFs orthogroups

>> Human, C.elegans and Dyctiostelium possess most “ancestral” RasGEFs
